# My logic here is to make a array from height and width. 
# from which i will get the total coordinates e.g. [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]
# I have the coordinates of the nuts. 
# Using squirel position  start while loop. Inc will be made in the coordinates and 
# distance variable is incremented as well. if the nuts coordinates is matched with the current position of the nuts. then the distance
# is added into the final distance variable.
